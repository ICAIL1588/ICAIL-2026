and<br>iii. the character of the government action.<br>(b) Except in rare circumstances, non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.<br><a name='765' href='658_Singapore US_2003Cut.txt.814_Costa Rica Singapore_2010 cut.txt.html#765'><font color='#FF0000'>Chapter Electronic Commerce<br>Article General<br>The Parties recognise the economic growth and </font></a>opportunities that electronic commerce provides, <a name='837' href='658_Singapore US_2003Cut.txt.814_Costa Rica Singapore_2010 cut.txt.html#837'><font color='#FF0000'>the importance of avoiding barriers to its use and development, and the applicability of WTO rules to </font></a>measures affecting electronic commerce.<br>For greater certainty, <a name='695' href='658_Singapore US_2003Cut.txt.814_Costa Rica Singapore_2010 cut.txt.html#695'><font color='#FF0000'>nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent </font></a><a name='95' href='658_Singapore US_2003Cut.txt.814_Costa Rica Singapore_2010 cut.txt.html#95'><font color='#FF0000'>a Party from imposing internal taxes, </font></a>directly or indirectly, on digital products, provided they <a name='616' href='658_Singapore US_2003Cut.txt.814_Costa Rica Singapore_2010 cut.txt.html#616'><font color='#FF0000'>are imposed in a manner consistent with this Agreement.<br></font></a><a name='39' href='658_Singapore US_2003Cut.txt.814_Costa Rica Singapore_2010 cut.txt.html#39'><font color='#FF0000'>Article Definitions<br>For purposes of this Chapter:<br>carrier medium means any physical object capable of storing </font></a>the digital codes that form <a name='469' href='658_Singapore US_2003Cut.txt.814_Costa Rica Singapore_2010 cut.txt.html#469'><font color='#FF0000'>a digital product by any method now known or later developed, and from which a digital product can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated, directly or indirectly, and includes </font></a><a name='414' href='658_Singapore US_2003Cut.txt.814_Costa Rica Singapore_2010 cut.txt.html#414'><font color='#FF0000'>an optical medium, a floppy disk, </font></a>and <a name='639' href='658_Singapore US_2003Cut.txt.814_Costa Rica Singapore_2010 cut.txt.html#639'><font color='#FF0000'>a magnetic tape;<br>digital products means computer programs, text, video, images, sound recordings, and other products that are digitally encoded, regardless of whether they are fixed on a carrier medium or transmitted electronically29;<br>electronic transmission or transmitted electronically means the transfer of digital products using any electromagnetic or photonic means;
